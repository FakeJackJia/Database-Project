# Database-Project
Developed a News Management System using Flask, integrating SQLAlchemy for MySQL and MongoEngine for MongoDB to handle news articles and user comments.

# Note
- Integrated Redis caching to optimize the retrieval of top news articles.
- There is a main page to present news for the users, and another admin page to manage news and comments.
